Simple application.<br>
About the databases downloaded on the Net, due to some errors, I cannot use the codes to download so that I downdoad them in their respective office website.<br>
1、[download databases and reading](https://github.com/Chengshu21/Practice-2017-2-9/tree/master/Download%20and%20read).
Before reading, download the file `4DGenome_full.txt` from [4DGenome](https://4dgenome.research.chop.edu/), `TF_human_data_information.txt` from [Cistrome Data Browser](http://cistrome.org/db/#/), `All.mitab.01-22-2018.txt` from [irefindex](http://irefindex.org/wiki/index.php?title=iRefIndex), `gencode.v27.annotation.gff3` from [gencode](https://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/current.html).<br>
* Be careful of the versions what the downloaded databases are.<br>
* Due to the output files of `4DGenome` is more than 25 MB, I don't upload it.<br> 

2、[get go annotation](https://github.com/Chengshu21/Practice-2017-2-9/blob/master/get%20Go%20annotation/get%20GO%20annotation.R).<br>

3、[query papers from Pubmed](https://github.com/Chengshu21/Practice-2017-2-9/blob/master/query%20papers%20from%20PubMed/query%20papers%20from%20PubMed.R).
