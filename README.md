Practices in different stages.  <br>
File folders are ordered by time.

1. `20170209`

Simple practices as follows:

    * Download databases and reading. Before reading, download the file 4DGenome_full.txt from 4DGenome, TF_human_data_information.txt from Cistrome Data Browser, All.mitab.01-22-2018.txt from irefindex, gencode.v27.annotation.gff3 from gencode.

Be careful of the versions what the downloaded databases are.
Due to the output files of 4DGenome is more than 25 MB, I don't upload it.

    * Get GO annotation.

    * Query papers from Pubmed.
