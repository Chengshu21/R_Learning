Practices in different stages.  <br>
File folders are ordered by time.

### 1. Folder: [**`20170209`**](https://github.com/Chengshu21/R_practice/tree/master/20170209)

Simple practices as follows:
* [Download databases and reading](https://github.com/Chengshu21/R_Learning/tree/master/20170209_Download%20and%20read).<br>
  Before reading, download the file `4DGenome_full.txt` from [4DGenome](https://4dgenome.research.chop.edu/), `TF_human_data_information.txt` from [Cistrome Data Browser](http://cistrome.org/db/#/), `All.mitab.01-22-2018.txt` from [irefindex](http://irefindex.org/wiki/index.php?title=iRefIndex), `gencode.v27.annotation.gff3` from [gencode](https://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/current.html).<br>
  Be careful of the versions what the downloaded databases are.<br>
  Due to the output files of `4DGenome` is more than 25 MB, I don't upload it.<br> 

* [Get GO annotation](https://github.com/Chengshu21/R_Learning/blob/master/20170209_get%20Go%20annotation/Get%20GO%20annotation.ipynb).

* [Query papers from Pubmed](https://github.com/Chengshu21/R_Learning/blob/master/20170209_query%20papers%20from%20PubMed/Query%20papers%20from%20PubMed.ipynb).
